# Project Opes

The idea behind project 'Opes' is to create a modular Forex (Foreign Exchange) bot trading network with ability to service multiple brokers simultaneously.
This is PRIMARILY an educational endeavour and should not be considered a working solution for automated Forex trading.

The base broker is [OANDA](http://developer.oanda.com/rest-live-v20/introduction/).
