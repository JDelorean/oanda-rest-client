# Project CashGrab

The idea behind this project is to create a modular Forex bot trading network with ability to service multiple brokers simultanously. 
This is PRIMARILY an educational endeavour and should not be considered a working solution for automated Forex trading.

The base broker is [OANDA](http://developer.oanda.com/rest-live-v20/introduction/).
